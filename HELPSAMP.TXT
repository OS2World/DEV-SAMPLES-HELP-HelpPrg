This is the main screen of help that first shows when you first open
the database under QuickHelp. It is also the text that will show
under PM using the help DLL, HELPLIB.DLL, a number of ways:

\b1)\p It should appear when the user presses F1 in your application
without having a specific help request. This is the default help.

\b2)\p When the Help dialog box is already open, if the user presses the
F1 key, as the DLL chains it way up the help tree, it will eventually
chain back to here.

It is the highest level help possible. I have also referenced it as
the 'About HELPSAMP' topic.
